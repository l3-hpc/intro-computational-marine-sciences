# Marine Science I Lab (MAS 331L)
Computational Lab for MAS 331L, 

Python for Marine Sciences

University of South Alabama

## How to use
Below are a series of Notebooks.  
- Clicking on the link title will show a static page of what the Notebook would look like.  
- Clicking on the "launch binder" icon will start the notebook
- Be patient, it takes time.  It is starting up a VM (little computer in the cloud), installing all the necessary Python packages, and loading the data.  For free!  Free is usually not fast...
