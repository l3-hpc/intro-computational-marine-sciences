# Marine Science I Lab (MAS 331L)
Computational Lab for MAS 331L 

Python for Marine Sciences

University of South Alabama

## How to use
Below are a series of Notebooks.  
- Clicking on the link title will show a static page of what the Notebook would look like.  
- Clicking on the "launch binder" icon will start the Notebook
- Be patient, it might take some time.  It is starting up a VM (little computer in the cloud), installing all the necessary Python packages, and loading the data...and all for free!  


## Contents
[Lab 3: Intro to Python, Part I](Lab3_Intro_to_Python_1.ipynb)
The content for this lab is taken directly from the [AGU 2021 Python for Earth Sciences workshop](https://github.com/modern-tools-workshop/AGU-python-workshop-2021), developed and led by [Rebekah Esmaili](http://www.rebekahesmaili.com) (bekah@umd.edu), Research Scientist, STC/JPSS.
- Why Python?
- Basic syntax, importing packages, lists and arrays
- Read in a CSV and examine the data
- Masking, filtering data
- Basic plots and figures

[Interactive Mapping: Mobile Bay](Mobile.ipynb)
- Uses open source mapping tool 'Leaflet'.  Try it out!  Add your house, or favorite parking place.
- Has a 'Colormap', for no apparent reason. Try it out!  Invent several new colormaps.
